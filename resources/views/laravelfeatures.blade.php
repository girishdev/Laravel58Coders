    <li>Support of Carbon 2.0<br>
        - The latest version of Laravel supports Carbon 2.0 (Carbon Date Manipulation Library) making it easier for the professionals to work with date and time. Carbon 2.0 includes a new Date facade along with a CarbonImmutable class. The CarbonImmutable class enables a user to make the copy of an original datum and to modify the copy without changing the original datum. It is possible to use this feature via the AppServiceProvider. To create a copy of any date and to use the Date façade, a user needs to update the ‘\routes\web.php’ file.
    </li>
    <li>Hashed Tokens<br>
        - It is not always necessary to use the Laravel Passport for the Laravel API authentication. However, most users are unaware of this fact. A user-friendly ‘token guard’ provides the basic API authentication. This facility is available through the earlier versions of Laravel. However, Laravel 5.8 comes with an additional facility. This latest version supports the storing of tokens as SHA-256 hashes. This feature offers a higher level of security when storing the tokens.
